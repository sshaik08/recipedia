        <h3>stocking your pantry</h3>
        <p>a well stocked pantry is the halfway point to being an efficient cook. making sure your pantry contains staple
            ingredients will save you a trip to the grocery store last minute, especially when you want a quick meal. specific
            staple ingredients include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>olive oil</li>
                <li>vegetable oil</li>
                <li>butter</li>
                <li>butter (salted and unsalted)</li>
                <li>salt and pepper</li>

                <li>sugar</li>
            </ul>
        <p>consider this a starting guide and not a comprehensive list of everything needed to whip up a feast in 20 minutes
        </p>
        <h3>cooking tips</h3>
        <p>when following a recipe, it's important to read through the entire thing (description, ingredients, directions)
            carefully to make sure that time-wise and ingredients-wise it is feasable. the last thing you want is to realize
            you're missing a key ingredient like the cocoa powder for your brownies. in addition, if you need to keep something
            in the oven/airfryer for 20 minutes when you only have 10 minutes to prepare your lunch for school, you'd want to realize
            sooner rather than later. lay out the ingredients and materials you need for a recipe before starting, so you can be
            sure that you have everything you need. as you begin cooking, taste your dish to make sure the spice/sugar/etc levels are to
            your liking. no recipe is perfect for everyone's tastes, and it's okay to stray a little from it. take notes of something being
            too much or not enough in your recipe, so you can adjust it next time. and finally, be patient. cooking is a science that
            can't be mastered in a day. take the time to let each step complete fully so that you can perfect and enjoy your dishes.
